# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, please pay attention to order them correctly.

# this is the base monasca-api requirements. To choose a particular
# implementation to install, run pip install -r xxx-requirements.txt.
#
# for example, to install monasca-api and v2 reference implementation, do the
# followings:
#
#    pip install -r requirements.txt -r ref-impl-requirements.txt
#
# The above will install monasca-api base and reference implementation
# dependencies.
#
# To install monasca-api and elasticsearch implementation, do the following:
#
#    pip install -r requirements.txt -r es-impl-requirements.txt
#
# The above command will install monasca-api base and elasticsearch
# implementation while leave other implementation dependencies alone.
